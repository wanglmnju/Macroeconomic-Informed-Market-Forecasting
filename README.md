# Macroeconomic-Informed-Market-Forecasting

üß† Objective
This project was completed as part of a technical challenge for a final-round interview with Data Analysis Inc. (DAI). The goal was to build a predictive model that forecasts the 5-day forward log return (with a 1-day lag) of the NASDAQ index (NASDAQCOM), using only information available at the time of prediction.

üóÉÔ∏è Data Sources
All economic indicators used are publicly available via:

FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)

ALFRED (Archival FRED) ‚Äì used for indicators that are subject to revisions (e.g., CPI and Nonfarm Payrolls)

Predictors include:

Effective Federal Funds Rate

2-Year Treasury Rate

10-Year Treasury Rate

Nonfarm Payrolls (from ALFRED)

Consumer Price Index (CPI-U, from ALFRED)

Volatility Index (VIX)

üîÑ Prediction Target
The model aims to predict:

scss
Copy
Edit
log(NASDAQ_t+5 / NASDAQ_t)
with a one-day lag for prediction execution (i.e., at time t-1, we use all available info to predict log_return(t, t+5)).

üß™ Modeling Approach
Data Preprocessing

Removed zero values in NASDAQCOM (treated as NULLs)

Used only data available at each point in time to avoid look-ahead bias

Interpolated and aligned indicators with NASDAQ dates

Feature Engineering

Created lagged versions of each macroeconomic indicator

Standardized features

Added temporal features (day of week, month, etc.)

Models Used

Baseline: Linear Regression, Ridge

Tree-based: XGBoost Regressor

Deep Learning: LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow) for time-dependent modeling

Evaluation

Train-test split aligned with time series (no random shuffling)

Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and directional accuracy (up/down prediction)

üìä Key Results
XGBoost achieved lowest RMSE and strong directional accuracy.

LSTM captured momentum patterns but was prone to overfitting.

Feature importance showed Treasury rates and VIX were leading indicators.

üöÄ Future Work
Incorporate additional lag structures and macro sentiment features.

Test rolling-window validation or walk-forward optimization.

Deploy model via a REST API for real-time testing.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras

matplotlib, seaborn

FRED/ALFRED API access via pandas_datareader
