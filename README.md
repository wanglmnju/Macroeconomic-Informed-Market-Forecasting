# Macroeconomic-Informed-Market-Forecasting

üß† Objective

This project was completed as part of a technical challenge for a final-round interview with Data Analysis Inc. (DAI). The goal was to build a predictive model that forecasts the 5-day forward log return (with a 1-day lag) of the NASDAQ index (NASDAQCOM), using only information available at the time of prediction.

üóÉÔ∏è Data Sources

All economic indicators used are publicly available via:

- FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)

- ALFRED (Archival FRED) ‚Äì used for indicators that are subject to revisions (e.g., CPI and Nonfarm Payrolls)

Predictors include:

- Effective Federal Funds Rate

- 2-Year Treasury Rate

- 10-Year Treasury Rate

- Nonfarm Payrolls (from ALFRED)

- Consumer Price Index (CPI-U, from ALFRED)

- Volatility Index (VIX)

üîÑ Prediction Target

The model aims to predict:

log(NASDAQ_t+5 / NASDAQ_t)

With a one-day lag for prediction execution (i.e., at time t+1, we use all available info to predict log_return(t+1, t+6)).

üß™ Modeling Approach

1. Data Preprocessing

- Removed zero values in NASDAQCOM (treated as NULLs)

- Used only data available at each point in time to avoid look-ahead bias

- Interpolated and aligned indicators with NASDAQ dates

2. Feature Engineering

- Created lagged versions of each macroeconomic indicator

- Standardized features

- Created new features:
  - Term Spread: Captures market expectations (inverted curve = recession signal)

  - Policy Spread: Measures how much markets "believe" the Fed (e.g., negative spread = tight policy)

3. Models Used

- Baseline: Average, Naive, Trend

- Regression: Linear Regression

- Tree-based: XGBoost Regressor

- statistical: SARIMAX

- Deep Learning: LSTM (Pytorch) for time-dependent modeling

4. Evaluation

- Train-test split aligned with time series (no random shuffling)

- Evaluated using RMSE, MAE

üìä Key Results
- Linear regression achieved the lowest MAE.

- XGBoost/LSTM captured momentum patterns but was prone to overfitting.

- Feature importance showed FRED and CPI were leading indicators.

üöÄ Future Work
- Incorporate additional lag structures and macro sentiment features.

- Test rolling-window validation or walk-forward optimization.

- Deploy the model via a REST API for real-time testing.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

- XGBoost, Pytorch

- matplotlib, seaborn

- FRED/ALFRED API access
